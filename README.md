# Mask-Detection
The given repo mainly shows how to train custom objects on yolov3.

## About YOLO
You only look once (YOLO) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system.The full detail of the working of YOLO and its performance is given in detail in the following link.

## Training Custom objects

Yolov3 is trained on coco dataset but we can train it for our own custom datasets,detailed information is given on the particular github repo

Mainly four custom files should be added for detecting the desired objects, as I have done for mask detection.
