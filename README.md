## Training Custom objects

Yolov3 is trained on coco dataset but we can train it for our own custom datasets,detailed information is given on the particular github repo

[darknet-cutom objects](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet)

Mainly four custom files should be added for detecting the desired objects, as I have done for mask detection.

1.obj.names

2.obj.classes

3.yolov3_obj.cfg
